I'm a quiet, staightforward and blunt person most of the time, I don't like sugarcoating shit so if you cant handle it DNI with me.

DNI if

INT

» if you need someone to talk to, ask beforehand.

I tend to stay afk in game, feel free to sit with whenever but I might not talk at all, dont take it personally ‹𝟹
Please refrain from flirting with me as it makes me very uncomfortable, jokes are fine and tonetags aren't needed for those who are wondering.
Avoid taking heavy inspo of my ocs, I dont want recolored versions of my characters. ^^
